(* The internal connection state we keep with every connection to a worker.

   [conn_state] is the user supplied connection state (well there is really a [Set_once.t]
   in there as well)

   [worker_state] is the worker state associated with the given worker. A reference is
   stored here to gracefully handle the cleanup needed when [close_server] is called when
   there are still open connections.

   [worker_id] is the id of the worker server that this connection is to. This is
   needed because there can be multiple instances of a given worker server in a single
   process.

   The [Rpc.Connection.t] is the underlying connection that has this state *)
