(** This module is primarily meant for backwards compatibility with code that used earlier
    versions of [Rpc_parallel]. Please consider using the [Rpc_parallel.Make()] functor
    instead as the semantics are more transparent and intuitive.

    This functor keeps cached connections to workers and dispatches on these connections.
    The semantics of reconnect are not currently well-defined. If you expect connections
    to drop or want multiple connections to the same worker, using [Rpc_parallel.Make()]
    is probably the better choice. *)
